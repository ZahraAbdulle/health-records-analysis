# Health Records Analysis

## Overview
This repository explores health record data, focusing on survival probabilities, hospital costs, and trends in disease-specific outcomes. The analysis provides insights into key areas of healthcare, helping to uncover patterns and trends that can inform better decision-making.

## Features
- Analysis of survival probabilities and hospital costs.
- Disease-specific trends and visualisation of health outcomes.
- Insights derived through Python using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Health records visualisations.ipynb` and run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Repository Contents
- **Health records visualisations.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualisations.
- **support2-1.csv**: The dataset used in the analysis, containing anonymised health record information.

## Dataset
The dataset `support2-1.csv` includes anonymised health record data with variables such as survival times, hospital costs, and diagnoses. This allows for a comprehensive exploration of healthcare trends.
